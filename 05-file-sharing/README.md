# Lesson Title: Sharing Files Between Your Guest and Host Machines

Major Objective: By the end of this lesson you will be able to share files between your host and guest machines.

Student Self-Check Tasks: file copied into local directory appears on the web server.

Rationale: This isn't necessary, but it's more convenient than SCPing files into your local server. 

Gotchas: Configuration is a little different on Windows and OSX. Emma: check your video notes from previous workshop.
