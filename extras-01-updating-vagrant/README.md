# Lesson Title: Updating Vagrant 

## Rationale

Sometimes upgrading doesn't work, so it's easier to rip everything off your system in order to upgrade.

## Lesson Outcomes

### Major Objective

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to remove relevant Vagrant from your system to prepare yourself for a clean installation.

### Student Self-Check Tasks

When I perform an "upgrade" I walk through the installation process as if I had never installed Vagrant on my system.
