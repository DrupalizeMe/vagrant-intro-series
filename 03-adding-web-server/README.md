# Lesson Title: Adding a Web Server

Major Objective: By the end of this lesson, you will be able to log into your virtual machine, and use the command line to install new software.

Student Self-Check Tasks: Log into the server via SSH. Add an AMP stack.

Rationale: This is something that ultimately we want to have in a provisioning script, but this shows you the virtual machine is just like any other server you might have worked with in the past. Any time you want to add new software, you can always come back to this lesson if you (for some reason) don't want to create a recipe and re-provision your machine. Hopefully by the end of this series you'll see why you should never *want* to use this method again.

Gotchas: OSX can use vagrant ssh; Windows will need to install PuTTY and use ssh vagrant.
