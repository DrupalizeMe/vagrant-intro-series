# Lesson Title: Using SSH on Windows 

Major Objective: By the end of this lesson you will be able to SSH into a remote
machine using PuTTY.

Student Self-Check Tasks: You can log into your Vagrant machine using PuTTY with the IP
address listed from running the command `vagrant ssh` in the same directory as your
Vagrantfile.

Rationale: `vagrant ssh` doesn't work on windows because of path issues. Although
you can update some files to fix this, running PuTTY is slightly more accessible
(and has a GUI configuration screen to fill in).
