vagrant-solo-dev
================

Getting up and running with Vagrant, a learning series by Drupalize.Me.

## Audience

### Primary Audience:

- Role: Developer - Novice
- Role: Site Builder - Intermediate

### Secondary Audience:

- Role: Technical PM - Advanced
- Role: System Administrator - Novice

### Key Problems:

- Want to eliminate the language of "works for me" between team members and improve ownership over problem, instead of saying it's the other's fault for not being able to make something work. 
- Want to eliminate "well it worked on my local" language, and have the local test environment mimic the server (e.g. different version of PHP).
- Development on Windows kinda sucks, let's get you a "real" server.
- OSX is shiny, but not the same as your beloved Linux machine, let's get you back to what you know.
